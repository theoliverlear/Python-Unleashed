### Chapter 0: Introduction

- What is Python?
    - Python is a high-level language that is easy to read and easy to use.
Python allows you to write code that is platform independent, concise, and
easy to maintain.
- Why Python?
    - Python's syntax is allows you to write code at a high velocity. More
importantly, Python is rich in libraries, allowing you to do almost anything
programmatically.
- What is an interpreted language?
    - Python is an interpreted language, meaning that it is not compiled into
machine code ahead of time. Instead, Python code is executed line by line at
runtime.
