## Get Started

You can create a GitHub Codespace under the green Code button. This will
create an IDE for you in the browser.

### Create a Codespace with Code Button

![Codespaces Example](./images/codespaces_example.png)

### Load the Codespace Environment

```bash
cd Powerful-Data-Science
```

```bash
bash ./init_codespace.sh
```

### Chapter 0: Introduction

- What is Python?
    - Python is a high-level language that is easy to read and easy to use.
Python allows you to write code that is platform independent, concise, and
easy to maintain.
- Why Python?
    - Python's syntax is allows you to write code at a high velocity. More
importantly, Python is rich in libraries, allowing you to do almost anything
programmatically.
- What is an interpreted language?
    - Python is an interpreted language, meaning that it is not compiled into
machine code ahead of time. Instead, Python code is executed line by line at
runtime.

### Chapter 6: Machine Learning 101
- What is Machine Learning?
  - Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that allows
computers to learn from data **without being explicitly programmed**.
- What is an epoch?
  - An epoch is one complete pass through the training data.
- What is batch size?
  - Batch size is the number of samples that are used in one iteration of
training before updating the model weights.
- What is loss?
  - Loss is a measure of how well the model is performing. It is a
function that takes the predicted values and the actual values and returns a
number that represents how far off the predicted values are from the actual.
- What is an optimizer?
  - An optimizer is an algorithm that is used to minimize the loss function.
- What is a learning rate?
